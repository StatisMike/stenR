Description: stenR creates an user-friendly R6 class to standardize raw discrete
             scores. It allows exporting standardized results for observations
             present in source data, as well as exporting frequency tables and
             scoring tables. It provides support for few standard scales often
             used in psychological questionnaires, though also allows using
             custom scales not provided out of the box.
