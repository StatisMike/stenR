- title: Basic normalization
  desc: |>
   Functions for basic (ungrouped) normalization in procedural workflow. They
   allow calculating table objects from raw scale/factor results and normalizing
   them (or new raw data) into quantiles, Z-scores or some standard score.
- contents:
  - StandardScale
  - FrequencyTable
  - ScoreTable
  - SimFrequencyTable
  - normalize_score
  - normalize_scores_df
- title: Grouping normalization
  desc: |>
   Functions for grouped normalization in procedural workflow. There are functions
   for creating groups/strata based on some conditions, extracting their data 
   from whole dataset, and creating table objects for each of these groups.
   Similarly to basic normalization, grouped normalization can be then made
   based on these tables.

  - GroupConditions
  - GroupAssignment
  - intersect_GroupAssignment
  - extract_observations
  - GroupedFrequencyTable
  - GroupedScoreTable
  - normalize_scores_grouped
  - plot.GroupedFrequencyTable
  - plot.GroupedScoreTable
- title: ScoringTable - portable object for normalization
  desc: |> 
   FrequencyTable and ScoreTable objects (and their grouped brethren) are easily
   created from raw data. They aren't as easile exported or imported, though.
   ScoringTable allows keeping the standardized scores for one scale in easily
   transferrable way, exporting them into `json` or `csv` objects and also
   importing them from these files. You can also create file to import yourself.
- contents:
  - to_ScoringTable
  - import_ScoringTable
  - export_ScoringTable
  - normalize_scores_scoring
- title: S3 classes manipulators
  desc: |>
   Simple helper functions for manipulation and transforming basic S3 classes.
- contents:
  - attach_scales
  - strip_ScoreTable
- title: Item score preprocessors
  desc: |>
   Data is most often available not as a raw scores of scales, but individual
   items. These functions are created to make your jouney from items to scales
   as painless as possible!
- contents:
  - ScaleSpec
  - CombScaleSpec
  - sum_items_to_scale
- title: Object Oriented workflow
  desc: |>
   Complex R6 object mirroring the ungrouped procedural workflow, allowing
   for much faster and expressive calculations and continuous recalculation
   of tables based on new data. Object for grouped tables coming soon!
- contents:
  - CompScoreTable
- title: Varia
  desc: |>
   Various additional simple functions, default StandardScale objects available
   within the package and some prepackaged data for learning.
