`stenR` is a package tailored mainly for users and creators of psychological questionnaires,
though other social science researchers and survey authors can benefit greatly
from it.

It provides tools to help with processes necessary for conducting such studies:

1. processing data from raw item scores to raw factor/scale scores
1. standardization of the raw scores into standard scale of your choosing, either
by:
   - normalization of the raw scores using frequency table (if no norms have
   been developed before). Usually for authors of questionnaires or their
   adaptations.
   - importing scoring table developed by questionnaire authors - for researchers
   only using the measure

Furthermore, tools for developing or using norms on grouped basis are also
provided (up to two intertwined grouping conditions are supported).

Most in-depth information is provided within vignette **Tour from data to results**
(for basic and verbose explanation) and less verbose but more complete in
**stenR usage** vignette.
